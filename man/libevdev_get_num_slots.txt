libevdev_get_num_slots(3)
=========================

NAME
----

libevdev_get_num_slots, libevdev_get_current_slot - get the number of available multitouch slots and the currently active slot

SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <libevdev/libevdev.h>

int libevdev_get_num_slots(const struct libevdev *dev);

int libevdev_get_current_slot(const struct libevdev *dev);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*libevdev_get_num_slots* returns the available number of multitouch slots on
this device.

*libevdev_get_current_slot* returns the currently active slot. Note that
this value may lag behind the state visible to other readers on the
same device. The return value of this function is the current slot as seen
by the caller, i.e. the state as defined by the set of events processed so
far.

PARAMETERS
----------
*dev*::
	Pointer to the libevdev device.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *libevdev_get_num_slots* returns the number of slots. If the
device does not support the slot protocol, -1 is returned.

On success, *libevdev_get_current_slot* returns the current of slot ID. If
the device does not support the slot protocol, the return value is
undefined.

NOTES
-----
Some devices support more touch points that they expose multitouch slots
for. For example, a touchpad may only expose two slots, but detect up to
four-finger touches. A caller should check for BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP,
BTN_TOOL_QUADTAP, etc. as well as the state of the slots.
