libevdev_get_event_type_name(3)
===============================

NAME
----

libevdev_get_event_type_name, libevdev_get_event_code_name, libevdev_get_input_prop_name - get the name of the event type, code or input property

SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <libevdev/libevdev.h>

const char * libevdev_get_event_type_name(unsigned int type);

const char * libevdev_get_event_code_name(unsigned int type, unsigned int code);

const char * libevdev_get_input_prop_name(unsigned int prop);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*libevdev_get_event_type_name*, *libevdev_get_event_code_name* and
*libevdev_get_input_prop_name* are helper functions for callers that need to
display the symbolic name of an event type or code or an input property.

*libevdev_get_event_type_name* returns the name of the event type as string.
Possible return values include EV_SYN, EV_REL, EV_ABS, EV_LED, etc.

*libevdev_get_event_code_name* returns the name of the event code as string.
Possible return values include ABS_X, ABS_Y, REL_X, BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP, etc.

*libevdev_get_input_prop_name* returns the name of the input property as
string. Possible return values include INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD,
INPUT_PROP_POINTER, etc.

PARAMETERS
----------
*type*::
	Specifies the event type to query. The valid range for 'type' is 0 to
	EV_MAX.

*code*::
	Specifies the event code to query. The valid range for 'code'
	depends on the 'type' and is defined in <linux/input.h>. For
	example, for 'type' EV_ABS, the range is 0 to 'ABS_MAX'.

*prop*::
	Specifies the input property to query. The valid range for 'prop' is
	0 to INPUT_PROP_MAX.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *libevdev_get_event_type_name* and *libevdev_get_event_code_name* return
the symbolic name of the event type or code. If no such name is defined or
'type' or 'code' are outside of the valid range, NULL is returned.


On success, *libevdev_get_input_prop_name* returns the symbolic name of the
input property. If no such name is defined or 'prop' is outside
of the valid range, NULL is returned.

NOTES
-----
Use with caution.
The set of event names is built into libevdev and does not change even if
the underlying kernel changes the set of symbolic names. It is the set of
event names as defined on the host libevdev was built on. A rebuild of
libevdev is required to sync the event names with linux/input.h.
This affects both event names and ranges.
