libevdev_disable_event_type(3)
==============================

NAME
----

libevdev_disable_event_type, libevdev_disable_event_code, libevdev_enable_event_type, libevdev_enable_event_code - disable or enable an event type or code on the device

SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <libevdev/libevdev.h>

int libevdev_disable_event_type(struct libevdev *dev, unsigned int type);

int libevdev_enable_event_type(struct libevdev *dev, unsigned int type);

int libevdev_disable_event_code(struct libevdev *dev, unsigned int type, unsigned int code);

int libevdev_disable_event_code(struct libevdev *dev, unsigned int type, unsigned int code, const void *data);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*libevdev_disable_event_type* and *libevdev_disable_event_code* disable
capabilities on this device. Once an event type or
code is disabled, future calls to *libevdev_has_event_type* and
*libevdev_has_event_code* will return 0.

*libevev_enable_event_type* and *libevdev_enable_event_code* enable
capabilities on this device. Once an event type or code is enabled, future
calls to *libevdev_has_event_type* and *libevdev_has_event_code* will return 1.

This change is library-internal only. Neither function disables the actual
axis on the device and other processes using libevdev to read from the
device will not see any changes.

PARAMETERS
----------
*dev*::
	Pointer to the libevdev device.

*type*::
	Specifies the event type to enable or disable.

*code*::
	Specifies the event code to enable or disable.

*data*::
	If type is EV_ABS, data points to a struct input_absinfo with the
	ranges for this axis. Otherwise, 'data' is ignored.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, these functions return 0. On failure, these functions return -1.

Failure indicates an invalid argument that is out of range from the kernel
parameters.
