libevdev_grab(3)
================

NAME
----

libevdev_grab - grab the kernel device and become its exclusive user.

SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <libevdev/libevdev.h>

enum EvdevGrabModes {
	LIBEVDEV_GRAB,
	LIBEVDEV_UNGRAB,
};

int libevdev_grab(struct libevdev *dev, int grab);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*libevdev_grab* performs an *EVIOCGRAB* on the kernel device, making this
process the exclusive recipient of events from that device. This disrupts
event delivery to other processes including in-kernel consumers of these
events such as *rfkill(1)*. It is usually a bad idea to use this function.

An attempt to grab or ungrab a device already grabbed or currently not
grabbed device will be ignored and returns success.

PARAMETERS
----------
*dev*::
	Pointer to the libevdev device.

*grab*::
	To grab the device, use LIBEVDEV_GRAB.
	To ungrab the device, use LIBEVDEV_UNGRAB.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, *libevdev_grab* returns zero. On failure, a negative errno is
returned.

*EINVAL*::
	An invalid grab mode was specified.

For a full list of potential error codes consult *ioctl(2)*.
