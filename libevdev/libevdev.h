/**

 *
 * libevdev is a library for handling evdev kernel devices. It abstracts
 * the ioctls through type-safe interfaces and provides functions to change
 * the appearance of the device.
 *
 * libevdev provides an interface for handling events, including most notably
 * SYN_DROPPED events.
 *
 * libevdev is signal-safe for the majority of its operations. Check the API
 * documentation to make sure, unless explicitly stated a call is <b>not</b>
 * signal safe.
 *
 * libevdev does not attempt duplicate detection. Initializing two libevdev
 * devices for the same fd is valid and behaves the same as for two different
 * devices.

 * struct libevdev *dev;
 * int err;

 * err = libevdev_set_fd(dev, fd);
 * if (err < 0) {
 *	printf("Failed (errno %d): %s\n", -err, strerror(-err));
 *
 * libevdev_free(dev);
 * @endcode
 *
 * libevdev_set_fd() is the central call and initializes the internal structs
 * for the device at the given fd. libevdev functions will fail if called
 * before libevdev_set_fd() unless documented otherwise.
